I am contributing  to Appwrite from quite a long time ,have more than 5 PRs merged ,I have contributed mainly to code but I have written some articles also .
Seeing a lot of transformation in this span .
I would like to suggest some points if it's possible 
1. Create a side navigation system that will make it simple for users to browse the Appwrite documentation.
2. Make use of SDK and version selection to give consumers rapid access to the particular section they need.
3. Include 'In this page' navigation with anchor links to make it simpler for customers to find what they're looking for on a lengthy page.
4. Create the page's main content using a variety of elements, including tables, lists, code samples, etc.
5. Create a search function to make it simple to locate information in the documentation.
6. Make the documentation more user-friendly on mobile devices, taking into mind any problems such incorrectly functioning tables.
7. Create a placeholder for the search feature that is currently being developed.
8. Give an illustration of each distinct design element and layout utilised in the documentation.
9. If necessary, suggest new parts for the design system.
10. Use your imagination to find new methods to improve the documentation's design without simply copying it.
