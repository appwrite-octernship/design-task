# Assignment
## Redesign Appwrite Docs

### Task instructions
The Appwrite documentation is one of the most important touchpoints that developers come in contact with while interacting with Appwrite: https://appwrite.io/docs. The docs are currently designed in our old design language. We recently launched our open-source design system: Pink Design. We used this design system to create the new Appwrite Console. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y05yxEM3nU&t=7s We are looking for an Octern that can help us with redesigning our Appwrite docs using this design system. Furthermore, we would love to see you demonstrate your user research abilities, by for example doing a competitive analysis of other docs, interviewing and usability testing, to come up with clever, research-based design solutions.

#### Key Features
- Side navigation to navigate within the docs 
- SDK and version selection, as can be seen on: https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account
- ‘In this page’ navigation, with anchor links, as can be seen on: https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account
- Main content of the page, with different components like tables, lists, code examples etc.
- Search in the docs


### Task Expectations
- Ideas on how we can optimize the docs for mobile are welcome. From research, we know that mobile usability could be more optimal. For example, the tables are not working well on mobile.
- We’re in the process of designing a search for the docs - you don’t have to design all the states of the search, but a place for the search needs to be included.
- You don’t have to redesign every single page in the docs, but rather have an example of all the unique layouts and components that are used throughout the docs: table, list, etc.
- Feel free to propose new components for the design system, if you feel like it can’t be solved with existing components. 
- Don’t be afraid to get creative, the redesign doesn’t have to be a direct translation of the old design of the docs. 


### Task submission
Submit a Figma link with your redesign, with your design rationale included in the Figma file.
