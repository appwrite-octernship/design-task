Hello ðŸ‘‹

1) I have made some of the changes regarding the top bar(the top bar can be changed by adding hover effects and a box like structure would appear at the time of hovering). 

2) Similarly in case of community page the "follow us" and "find open-projects" section can changed to animation type by adding a hover effect.
